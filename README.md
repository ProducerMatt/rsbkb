# rsbkb

A Rust reimplementation of some tools found in emonti's
[rbkb](https://github.com/emonti/rbkb), itself a Ruby reimplementation of
Matasano's BlackBag.

## Why reimplement it ?

* rbkb is unmaintained
* Ruby is slow
* I wanted to learn Rust

## Included tools

* `unhex`
* `hex`
* `d64`
* `b64`
* `urldec`
* `urlenc`
* `xor`
* `crc16`
* `crc32`
